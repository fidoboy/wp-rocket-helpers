This helper plugin lets you exclude specific fonts from being preloaded by WP Rocket's Fonts Preload optimization: [WP Rocket: Preload Fonts](https://docs.wp-rocket.me/article/1317-preload-fonts)

üìù&#160;&#160;**Manual code edit required before use!**


**How to use**

To define the fonts you want to exclude:

1. Open the plugin file.
2. Find this section:

```php
// START editing ‚Äî add full or partial font filenames to exclude as in the examples below
// $exclusions[] = 'OpenSans.woff2';
// $exclusions[] = 'my-font-subset.woff';
// END editing
```
You can uncomment one of the examples or add one, per font you want to exclude:

     $exclusions[] = 'your-font-file.woff2'; 

3. Save the file, zip it
4. Upload the plugin to your WordPress site and activate it
